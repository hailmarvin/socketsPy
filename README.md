## SocketPy
Experimenting with pythons sockets
Currently implimented with buffering and streaming
Added simple chatroom app 
Allows multiple users to communicate with handling errors

Uses pyaudio to record and wave to save the voice note in .wav format
Voice app works but sound quality is poor.
Video app freezes on first frame needs debugging
